//Quiz
// 1. The difference between var and let is that var can redeclare its variables, each variable is separated by a function scope, and it can use hoisting while let can't redeclare variables, each variable is separated by a block scope, and it can't use hoisting.
// 2. Var can redeclare its variables, it can also reassign variables, each variable is separated by a function scope, and it can use hoisting. Const can't redeclare variables nor can it reassign them, each variable is separated by a block scope, and it also can't use hoisting.
// 3. The difference between let and const is that let variables can be reassigned while const can't reassign its variables.
// 4. Hoisting is when a variable has been declared and sent to the top of the scope there in. The variables can be accessed before it is actually used. Variables with var and function declarations are examples that can be hoisted.
